# Planar Disruption Detector

Detects planes from the rgb and depth images obtained from a Kinect v2. Then it segments extrusions or intrusions within a plane to mark them as potentially useful for a robot.

Abandoned for a new project that is more time efficient called the Planar Extraction and Feature Matching Application for Camera Localization, which is private for now until I finish it and present it at CMU's Meeting of the Minds, which is Carnegie Mellon University's undergraduate research fair in May.
